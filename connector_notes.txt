# KLX ECU Connector I/O Notes

## Engine Sensors

### Crankshaft Position (CKP +/-)

Stock crank position sensor is 18 tooth, probably a VR sensor of some sort (2 wire). Peak of 3.2 V or higher.

#### Connections

Pin 3 (CKP +)
Pin 9 (CKP -)

### Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)

Potentiometer connected to +5V and GND. Wiper of the potentiometer is connected to the TPS pin, indicating the throttle position.

Output is 0.58-0.62V at idle, 3.7 to 3.9V at WOT 

#### Connections

Pin 5

### Intake Air Pressure sensor

Wired in a similar way to the TPS, it's connected to +5V and GND. Output is connected to the MAP pin

Output voltage is 2.87V - 2.93V at 101.35 kPa

#### Connections

Pin 6

### Intake Air Temperature Sensor

NTC thermistor, with an internal pullup from the ECU. The following info is based on the service manual, and not actual testing

- 5.4k - 6.6k (avg 6,000) at 0c
- 0.29k - 0.39k (avg 340) at 80c

Based on averages, that gives a beta value ~3461.29

2.25V - 2.5V (avg 2.375) output at 20c

20c means an approximate resistance of 2528 ohms.

### Coolant Temperature Sensor (CLT)

Resistance spec according to the manual

- -20c : 18.80k +- 2.37k
- 0c : ~6.544k
- 40c : 1.136k +- 0.095k
- 100c : 0.1553k +- 0.0070

Spec voltage of 2.8V-2.97V at 20c
